***************** cappuccino.org *****************

This is the beginnings of a new site for the
Cappuccino project. It's powered by Narwhal, and
a custom "web framework" designed to serve content
with a combination of templates, controllers, and
static files.

Right now, the plan for handling a URL is this:

1) If there's a static resources (/public/x), 
   deliver the static file directly, bypassing
   Narwhal entirely.

2) If there's a custom route defined, use it.

3) If not, check for a controller with the given
   name (/posts would look for a posts controller)
   and execute the relevant method on that 
   controller, passing the output through a 
   template if one is available.

4) If there's no controller, look in the templates
   folder for a template with the same name. This
   will let us build semi-static pages which still
   use the templating system for partials, etc.

5) Error page.
